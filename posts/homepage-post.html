<h3>News Magazines</h3>

<h4><a href="http://femmagazine.com/">Fem</a></h4>

<p>FEM, UCLA’s feminist newsmagazine since 1973, is dedicated to the empowerment of all women, the promotion of human rights, the recognition of gender diversity, and the application of intersectional feminism. FEM celebrates women’s right to equality in all aspects of life and appeals to an audience that believes feminist ideology is still necessary to defeat sexism. We will offer a wide range of timely feature, opinion, and news pieces that tackle gender issues in relation to sexuality, race, class, and popular culture. The purpose of FEM is to enlighten our audience with information and personal accounts that may be rejected or ignored within mainstream media.</p>

<h4><a href="http://lagente.org/">La Gente</a></h4>

<p>La Gente Newsmagazine, born from the Chicana/o movement, arose out of a need to represent the Latina/o community and their issues in UCLA and the greater Los Angeles area. In an effort to be the voice of Latina/o experiences, we have featured news and opinions that highlight our communities since 1971. We continue to provide the latest on art, culture, community, and university news and events relating to our communities.</p>
