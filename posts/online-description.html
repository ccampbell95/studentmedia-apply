<h3>Internship</h3>
<p>As a web developer intern you'll gain experience with web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript as well as practical experience working in teams to create web projects on deadline. Daily Bruin Online contributors have had software engineering and product management internships at Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, Adobe, Disney, Bloomberg, MongoDB, among others. </p>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>We welcome applicants of all levels and have had successful contributors come in with no prior programming experience as well as those with more expertise. We have projects of varying scope and complexity from making pages with only HTML/CSS to working developing visualizations with various charting libraries to developing apps with MVC frameworks (i.e. Django) that power some of our sub sites and magazines. We also love applicants with design experience.</p>
